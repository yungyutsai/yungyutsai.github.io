I am an assistant professor at the <a href="https://ici.nccu.edu.tw" target="_blank">International College of Innovation</a> at the National Chengchi University (國立政治大學創新國際學院).

As an empirical public policy scholar, I study how policy design, fiscal resources, and incentive structures shape individual behavior and institutional performance. My work lies at the intersection of public policy, public finance, and social equity. Drawing on population‑scale administrative data, survey micro‑data, and a suite of causal inference and other rigorous quantitative methods, I address questions central to social equity and government effectiveness. Across projects, the throughline is a commitment to actionable evidence that supports fairer, more accountable, and more innovative public policy.

I earned a PhD in Public Affairs from the University of Missouri’s <a href="https://truman.missouri.edu" target="_blank">Harry S Truman School of Government and Public Affairs</a> in 2025. I also hold an MPA (Master of Public Administration) from National Chengchi University (Taiwan, 2019) and a BA in Political Science from National Taiwan University (2015); before beginning graduate study, I worked in the Congress of Taiwan.
