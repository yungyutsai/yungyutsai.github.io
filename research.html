<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> U.S. higher education institutions are hiring more
minoritized faculty into their teaching workforce to satisfy the demand
of an increasingly diverse racial and ethnic student population.
However, it is not always clear whether specific hiring policies and
plans are intended to address the matter of diversity or
representation—two similar but qualitatively different concepts. The
policy choices that institutions make result in different implementation
approaches and long-term outcomes. Using data from the Integrated
Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) from 2001 to 2021, this
study measures and compares the changes in faculty diversity and
student–faculty representation in U.S. higher education institutions
over the past two decades. It then develops several simulated scenarios
to project the future racial and ethnic landscape of American campuses,
depending on the different policy choices that institutions make through
their hiring and retention policies. Our recommendation calls for
balanced efforts in the retention and hiring of minoritized and
underrepresented faculty that are adapted to the individual
circumstances of institutions. </font size>

<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> Utilizing administrative data encompassing the entire
population of Taiwan, this paper investigates the long-term effects of
job displacement on earnings and mental health. Focusing on job loss
resulting from mass layoffs and plant closures, our estimates suggest
displaced workers experienced a 67–68% earning loss in the year
following a layoff. Even after ten years, earnings do not fully recover.
Displaced workers also experience long-term deterioration in mental
health, particularly related to stress, with a 15–16% increase in
cumulative outpatient visits for mental health issues and a 57–62%
increase in cumulative medical costs for mental illness in the decade
post-displacement. The negative impact on mental health is more
pronounced among workers with lower earnings, men, and older
individuals. </font size>

<font size=2> This study investigates the impact of teacher favoritism
(i.e., systematically favoring students of a specific gender, ethnicity,
or high previous class ranking) on teacher treatment and student
achievement. Based on the practice of random class grouping within
schools, a school fixed effect model is used to estimate the causal
effect of teacher favoritism. The results suggest that teacher
favoritism toward students with a higher previous class rank increases
the likelihood of these students consulting with their teacher on
academic, emotional, and friendship issues. Also, female students are
more likely to discuss friendships and emotional matters with pro-female
teachers. However, the evidence of teacher favoritism’s impact on
student achievement is relatively weak. </font size>

<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> Healthcare has been one of the most affected sectors
during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The utilization
of related services for non-COVID-19 diseases fell dramatically
following the point at which the virus broke out; however, little is
known about whether this observed decline in healthcare use was due to
voluntary behaviors or enforced measures. This paper quantifies the
spontaneous change in healthcare utilization during the pandemic. We
utilize a county-by-week-level dataset from Taiwan’s National Health
Insurance (NHI) record, covering the entire Taiwanese population, and a
difference-in-differences design. Our results indicate that even if
there were no human mobility restrictions or supply-side constraints,
people voluntarily reduced their demand for healthcare, due to fears of
contagion, or COVID-related precautionary behaviors. We find that the
number of outpatient visits (inpatient admissions) decreased by 19%
(10%) during the pandemic period (February to May 2020). Furthermore,
the demand response of healthcare for Influenza-like illness (ILI) was
much greater and more persistent than for non-ILI, thereby suggesting
that the substantial decline in accessing healthcare was induced by
positive public health externality of prevention measures for COVID-19.
Finally, we find that the demand for healthcare services did not get
back to the pre-pandemic baseline, even when there were no local
coronavirus cases for 253 consecutive days (mid-April to December 2020)
in Taiwan. </font size>

This paper uses data from the art funding list from 2015 to 2017 in Taiwan to examine whether The National Culture and Arts Foundation (NCAF, an intermediary cultural organization) distributes funding fairer than The Ministry of Culture (MOC). There are three different concepts of fairness: equity, equality, and need (distributing funding to those who need it). The result of this paper shows MOC and NCAF have no significant difference in equity, but NCAF indeed performs better on equality and need than MOC, although the effect isn’t as strong as we thought. Based on these findings, this paper suggests that the arm’s length principle really works, and it’s necessary for MOC to collaborate with NCAF. However, it’s also important to improve the fairness of art funding allocation in the future. </font size></div>

prizes to examine the causal effect of financial resources on fertility.
We employ extensive panels of administrative data encompassing over 0.4
million lottery winners in Taiwan and implement a triple-differences
design. Our analyses reveal that a substantial lottery win can
significantly increase fertility, the implied wealth elasticity of which
is around 0.06. Moreover, the primary channel through which fertility
increases is by prompting first births among previously childless
individuals. Finally, our analysis reveals that approximately 25% of the
total fertility effect stems from increased marriage rates following a
lottery win. </font size>

<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act introduced a net investment
income tax on select wealthy nonprofit colleges. This study examines
institutional responses and their impact on educational access. Findings
suggest that taxed colleges raised tuition, transferring the burden to
students and reducing access for historically underserved groups.
However, some colleges strategically increased enrollment to circumvent
the tax threshold, creating more educational opportunities. These
contrasting responses highlight how policy design significantly
influences institutional reactions to taxation. While the tax aimed to
address wealth concentration in higher education, its implementation
produced mixed results — in some cases undermining educational access
while in others expanding it. The findings demonstrate how tax policy
can guide institutional behavior toward socially beneficial outcomes.

<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> The US federal government has been investing in workforce
diversity, yet people of color remain underrepresented in leadership,
creating challenges for supervisors of color. This study examines how
same-race subordinates affect supervisors’ job satisfaction using
federal employee data from 2020-2023. Results show an asymmetric effect:
while White supervisors benefit from more same-race subordinates,
supervisors of color experience decreased job satisfaction. This
negative effect diminishes as minority representation in leadership
increases, becoming positive when they exceed 35% of supervisors. Role
clarity and supervisor relationships mediate these effects, suggesting
supervisors of color face role conflict between organizational norms and
community expectations. The findings highlight the burden of
representation faced by minority supervisors and the importance of
achieving critical mass in leadership positions. </font size>

<font size=2>Abstract</font size>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> While contracting out is often viewed as having negative
consequences for public employees, less focus has been placed on
understanding how it can also have positive outcomes for them. Recent
scholarship proposes that contracting out may improve employees’ work
attitudes when it emphasizes pro-social factors. Using the U.S. federal
small, disadvantaged business (SDB) contracting program—which emphasizes
diversity and equity in procurement—as an example, this study examines
the relationship between contracting programs aimed at promoting social
outcomes and public employees’ job satisfaction. Drawing insights from
public administration research, we expect a positive relationship
between the SDB contracting efforts and public employees’ satisfaction.
The U.S. federal government procurement data and the Federal Employee
Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) were used for analysis. The results show that
increased SDB contracting is associated with enhanced job satisfaction.
In addition, employees of underrepresented backgrounds experience a more
pronounced increase in satisfaction linked to SDB contracting
initiatives. The implications of the findings for government contracting
and public human resource management are discussed. </font size>

prices—Trade-offs between tax fairness and housing equity.
<details>
<summary>
<font size=2>Abstract</font size>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> Property reassessments aim to align property’s assessed
values with market prices, serving as an essential tool to ensure tax
fairness. However, reassessments can unintentionally impact housing
values and, therefore, affect wealth distribution. Based on data from 19
Pennsylvania counties, this study examines property reassessment’s
impact on housing values. The paper explores two contrasting theories:
the capitalization effect, which predicts reduced housing values in
wealthy regions and increased prices in less developed areas, and the
anchoring effect, anticipating more pronounced price increases in
affluent regions and wider disparities in housing prices. Using a
difference-in-differences approach and instrumental variable analysis,
the study finds the anchoring effect dominates. On average, property
reassessment raises housing values by 9% in counties, with a pronounced
positive effect in high-priced regions and a negative impact in
non-affluent regions. This highlights that while reassessment enhances
tax fairness, it also disproportionately benefits wealthier individuals
and widens geographical disparity in housing prices, contradicting
wealth equality goals. </font size>

<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> This study investigates the influence of residing in
student dormitories on short and long-term student outcomes within the
context of Taiwan. This research examines the causal effects of
on-campus residency by utilizing colleges’ dormitory assignment policy
based on students’ residential locations and employing a boundary-based
regression discontinuity design. The study incorporates a two-way fixed
effect model, including both college and village fixed effects, to
account for potential geographical self-selection biases. The findings
reveal that on-campus living doesn’t significantly impact persistence,
but it does enhance the likelihood of pursuing graduate education,
primarily influenced by enrolling in the same college for undergraduate
studies. This positive effect can be attributed to two intermediate
outcomes: an increase in on-campus employment, indicative of greater
on-campus engagement, and a higher likelihood of receiving awards from
contests or competitions, suggesting increased participation in
extracurricular activities. The impact is more pronounced among students
from low-income families, those without siblings, and those attending
more prestigious colleges. </font size>

<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> This study examines the impact of a Taiwanese upper
secondary admission reform, which reduces the level of tracking without
abandoning the general/vocational dual-track system. I utilize a
difference-in-differences framework, comparing the difference of high
school (exposed to the reform) and middle school (non-exposed to the
reform) students before and after the reform. The results suggest that
the reform raises the within-school student heterogeneity by around half
the gap between full tracking and non-tracking system. Furthermore, the
de-tracking reform leads to a 0.148 standard deviation drop in average
student performance. The de-tracking policy yields an evenly negative
impact throughout the whole distribution, implying that the efficiency
gained from the tracking does not at the cost of equity. </font size>

<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> Market competition is a fundamental justification for
government contracting, yet competitive environments are often difficult
to achieve in practice. This study examines how state-imposed
administrative burdens affect competition in government contracting and
whether extending solicitation durations can mitigate these burdens.
Analyzing 79,968 contracts and 184,550 bids from Taiwan’s e-procurement
system, we find that both learning costs (measured by bidding
instruction length) and compliance costs (measured by document
requirements and deposit mandates) significantly reduce market
competition. Importantly, longer solicitation periods partially offset
the negative effect of documents and deposit requirements, though they
do not mitigate the negative impact of lengthy bidding instructions. Our
findings contribute to contracting literature by applying an
administrative burden framework to business-government interactions and
offer practical strategies for procurement officials seeking to enhance
market competition. </font size>
